## Description

Repository for magnetic resonance imaging data from the project&nbsp;titled "Stress-inducible phosphoprotein 1 (HOP/STI1/STIP1) regulates the spreading, aggregation, and toxicity of α-synuclein in vivo"<br /><br />Contains the pre-processed ex vivo T1-weighted images (Bruker 7T; 70 micron isotropic voxel resolution) for WT mice, M83 homozygous, and M83 homozygous mice with one copy of the TPR transgene. Full subject list can be viewed with the&nbsp;prado\_MRI\_M83dTPR\_subjectlist\_final.csv file.<br /><br />Whole brain region segmentations are available for these mice. These labels were generated using the MAGeT-Brain segementation pipleine (https://github.com/CobraLab/MAGeTbrain) and using a modified/merged version of the Allen brain atlas. The full list of regions included can be found in the file named Allen\_brain\_mapping\_final.csv.<br /><br />See readme.txt file for more information
